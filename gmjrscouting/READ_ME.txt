A TWEAKS
This is a rough template .. when you are done I'll still need to do a bunch of spacing tweaks and all sorts of other tweaks (background images, etc) but that's about it, mostly making the site look good and compatible on Android (it's mostly ok on iPhone, iPad and laptop.)

B NOTEBOOK SKETCHES
Pages made not in NOTEBOOK_SKETCHES folder (rough sketches Russ did on how he wants the site to look, content, etc which you can use for reference but that's mostly for me .. I created pages based soley on these sketches):

 1) rankings

C STUFF WE NEED FROM RUSS
Must discuss:

 1) articles .. not sure he needs a 'blog', he just wants to be able to post articles (which is blog-like I guess) .. so simplest method best
 2) client login: only for those who pay, the rest just get limited views
 3) pay system
 4) only two pages I didn't create yet but seem to be replicas of already existing pages so need clarification from Russ on 'second pages' (in NOTEBOOK_SKETCHES folder):
   a) hits and misses (2nd page),
   b) all star game (next page)

D REFERENCE
Refer to the notes I sent you from the last meeting I had with Russ in May .. his thoughts, etc are represented there (WEBSITE-COMMENTS-DIRECTION.docx.)
