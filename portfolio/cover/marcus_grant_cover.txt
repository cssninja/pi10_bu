Since 2005 I’ve become a highly skilled product designer .. utilizing visual, UI and UX design. My creative existence is absorbed in all things design: illustration, branding, UI design for mobile and desktop, and UX design. I love typography and flat design based color palettes.

I'm also a front-end coding ninja, am a Bootstrap expert and craft Shopify stores as well (a combination of their native templating language Liquid plus normal front end languages). I’m currently studying more languages: React  (a Javascript language) and Python, to increase my skill sets .. and to increase my fluency and connection with developers as a designer (and perhaps future CEO).

I actually enjoy problem solving (a passion) .. whether it is a design challenge to create from scratch a corporate identity or a developer challenge to tweak front end coding for a robust responsive design experience that works flawlessly on all platforms (desktop, tablet, mobile .. iOS and Android .. and all browsers).

Beyond design and developing I’m also fully immersed and fluent in startup culture, from AI to distributed web (another passion) to the ethereal mathematics that empowers it all.

On breaks I enjoy building wooden things (alpine furniture and meditation tree houses), vegan food, and long runs in the country (I’m a lifelong athlete). 

My home page is:  https://pionezero.com/

For each project on my home page there are 4 possible icons > 1) laptop icon, 2) basketball icon, 3) coding icon and 4) four arrows icon for > 1) the website I did for my client, 2) my Dribbble design portfolio with lots of design samples, 3) coding samples and 4) an on page version with the complete design sampling that drops down like a drop down menu when clicked.

Kind regards,
Marcus Grant
