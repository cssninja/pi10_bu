Iâ€™m a highly skilled product designer, utilizing visual, UI and UX design. My creative existence is absorbed in all things design: illustration, branding, UI design for mobile and desktop, and UX design. I'm a front-end coding ninja and craft Shopify stores as well. On breaks I enjoy building wooden things (alpine furniture and meditation tree houses), vegan food, and long runs in the country. I'm fully immersed and fluent in startup culture, from AI to distributed web to the ethereal mathematics that empowers it all.
